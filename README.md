A Flutter Apprentice tutorial by Ray Wenderlich. 

## Description
This is Section II: Chapter 8 of the Flutter Apprentice Tutorial titled:

### 8. Deep Links and Web URLs

Learn how to deep link to screens in the app and handle web URLs.

  - Parse URL strings and query parameters
  - Convert a URL to and from the app state 
  - Support deep linking on iOS and Android
  - Support URL-driven navigation in the browser for Flutter web apps.

For me, this was mostly a copy/paste exercise.
While displaying "real" urls in the web app are important, this is not a topic I want to spend too much time on right now.
The next chapters of Networking, Persistence and State are (at this time) more important to me.
